This repository contains the SQL scripts used to analyze the performance of Atliq Hardwares, a leading computer hardware producer in India. Despite their prominent position, the management has identified a critical gap in their decision-making process due to a lack of actionable insights. The input data consists of sales data for FY 2020 and FY 2021, along with various dimension tables like customer and product details.

## Introduction
Atliq Hardwares is a prominent name in the computer hardware production industry in India. Despite their leading position, the management has identified a critical gap in their decision-making process due to a lack of actionable insights. To address this issue, the project aims to provide valuable insights into ten specific ad-hoc business requests. These insights will be derived from data stored in AtliQ ‘s internal databases.

## Data Sources
The analysis is based on data obtained from AtliQ’s internal databases. The main datasets used include fact_sales_monthly, dim_product, dim_customer, and supporting tables such as fact_manufacturing_cost, fact_pre_invoice_deductions, and fact_gross_price. The input data consists of sales data for FY 2020 and FY 2021, along with various dimension tables like customer and product details.

## Project Overview
1. Utilize SQL queries to retrieve relevant data from the company's internal databases.
2. Convert the results of these queries into clear and meaningful visualizations.
