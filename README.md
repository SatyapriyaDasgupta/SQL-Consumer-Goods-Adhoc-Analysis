# SQL: Consumer Goods Adhoc Analysis
This repository contains SQL scripts developed to support ad-hoc business analysis for Atliq Hardwares, a major computer hardware manufacturer in India. Despite their prominent position, the management has identified a critical gap in their decision-making process due to a lack of actionable insights. This project aims to bridge that gap by delivering targeted insights through structured data analysis. As part of the initiative, I was assigned to work on 10 specific ad-hoc business requests.

## Project Objective

Extracting and aggregating data from internal databases.
Providing clear, business-relevant findings to support strategic decisions.

## Data Sources

The analysis uses structured data from Atliq’s internal systems, including:
